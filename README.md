Backgrounds of sequencing.
paired-end TruSeq Stranded mRNA libraries (Illumina, CA, USA) were constructed and over 20M of 50 bp reads/sample were sequenced. For this study, a total of 60 brain samples were sequenced, consisting of 5 biological replicates at four different time points (6, 13, 120 dpf, and acute-stressed at 120dpf) in each of three groups (wildtype (WT), bPAC+, and bPAC-). Raw sequenced reads(.fastq) have been deposited in ENA (PRJEB53713).
